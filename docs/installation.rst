Official Client
===============

We maintain the official NSoT client under a separate project called `pyNSoT
<https://pynsot.readthedocs.org>`_. PyNSoT provides a Python API client and an
excellent CLI utility.

If you wish to utilize NSoT from the command-line, or follow along in the
:doc:`tutorial`, you're going to need this!

Installing the client is as easy as running ``pip install pynsot``. Setup is a
breeze, too. If you run into any issues, please refer to the `official pyNSoT
documentation <https://pynsot.readthedocs.org>`_.

Demo
====

If you would like to run the demo, make sure you've got NSoT installed and that
you have a fresh clone of the NSoT repository from GitHub.

If you don't already have a clone, clone it and change into the ``nsot``
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/dropbox/nsot
    $ cd nsot

Then to switch to the  ``demo`` directory and fire up the demo:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd nsot/demo
   $ ./run_demo.sh

The demo will be available at http://localhost:8990/
