Support
=======

Network Source of Truth is a primarily a Pacific coast operation, so your best
chance of getting a real-time response is during the weekdays, Pacific time.

The best way to get support, provide feedback, ask questions, or to just talk
shop is to find us online on Slack.

We have a bi-directional Slack/IRC bridge for our channels so that users can
use whichever they prefer.
